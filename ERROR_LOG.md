### E-0001 — Empty Git repository could not create first phase branch
- Observed: GitHub rejected branch creation because the repository had no commits.
- Cause: repository initialized but empty.
- Fix: created an initial README.md commit on main, then created phase-0-governance.
- Prevention: verify the repository has an initial commit before branch creation.

### E-0002 — No production option dataset available in target repository
- Observed: repository contents endpoint returned 404 because the repo was empty before initialization.
- Research implication: no real backtest result is claimed at this stage.
- Fix: build the engine and deterministic tests first; defer historical results until cached data is added.

### E-0003 — Local clone/network verification unavailable
- Observed: a container git clone of github.com failed with DNS/network resolution error.
- Research implication: no claim is made that tests were locally executed in this session.
- Fix: commit deterministic tests and a manual/push GitHub Actions workflow so CI can perform the authoritative software check.
- Prevention: treat external-network execution as optional; keep reproducible CI in the repository.
